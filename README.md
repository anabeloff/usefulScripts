<h2> Useful Scripts</h2>
</br>
Collection of scripts and pipelenes I find useful in daily work with biological data analysis.
These include R and Bash scripts and pipelines. As well as R Notebook files with code and manuals.

<h3>Tax2taxid.R</h3></br>
This script comes useful if you want to train RDP classifer with your own dataset. Training requers a taxid file along with sequence file.
